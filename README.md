PROJECT NAME

Studio 21 by Jane Murphy 

In this project I wanted to create a portfolio website for a for photographer to showcase their skills 
while also providing a snippet of what they can offer,which would hopefully leave the visitor with 
a bit of intrigue. 

Also I thought it would be a good firsr milestone project to do as it would
use a lot of similar coding techniques that I have learner thus far in the course.

UX

This website is focused on anyone wanting a portfolio style website. In regards to what the website should achieve
for the viewer is a sense of knowing the person before any contact is made. The "Testimonials" provide a nice message about
person as well as the "About" providing a glimpe into who the person really is. This format of website is set up in a way that
the visitor is greeted with some nice words about the person and then if they were to navigate through the site further they would
see a sample of the person works and also a section that describes them in detail.

"As someone in need of a wedding photographer, I want to find someone reliable and with the skills and experience
to deliver a quality set of photographs for my big day."

"As someone looking to boost their own website with photographs of their work,
 I want to find someone with experience in this field so I get the best outcome."

FEATURES

The first feature that everyone who visits this site will come across is the hom page photograph which doubles as a link
to the homepage.

Next is the hover function on all navigation links.

Also on the homepage in the footer section is the social links which at the minute navigate to the homepage also but it
bring the user to a new tab completely.

Another homepage feature is the clickable icon to bring the user direct to the Contact page.

Inside the Gallery page the user will find a Hover function implimented on all gallery photos.

Finally in the Contact page the user will see an interactive contact form with clickable submit button below.

Future features to implemented would be the social links to connect to their respective sites.

TESTING

My automated tests for this project are as follows:

    - Making sure the navigation bar links would hover when the mouse was placed over them.
    
    - Making sure the navigations links brought me to the right pages.
    
    - Making sure the image in the header would always bring the user back to the homepage.
    
    - Making sure the contact and social links in the footer would work and bring the user to the right page when clicked.
    
    - Making sure the gallery images would increase in sixe when hovred over and decrease when the mouse
      had moved to another image.
      
    - Making sure the contact form would'nt allow the user to submit without a fully complete form 
      including a proper email, name and description provided.
